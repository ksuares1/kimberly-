          Achoo focuses on the general publicâ€™s inability to distinguish between
                    the common cold and flu, and this mishap can lead to severe consequences.
                    Users are asked a series of questions to determine whether or not they have the cold or flu.
                    Often times people mistake the flu for the common cold, and this is what has led to many
                    deaths. Being able to recognize and differentiate between the cold and flu, will save many lives.
